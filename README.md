# Running Aces

The project is a JavaScript-based website-oriented 16-bit-style pixel art game.

## Game Overview

The game focuses around multiple players betting on cards. However, for this
implementation only one player will be allowed to place a bet on a card. At the
start of the round players can choose a specific card suit that they believe
will win the race. At this point, the race starts.

On the right-hand side of the cards is a stack of five face-down cards. Four
aces are laid down

## Assets Used

The SVG playing cards were originally developed by David Bellot and recreated by
Huub de Beer.
